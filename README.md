Pokemon Safari

Pokemon Safari is made using Visual Studio Code with materialize as the main is CSS framework. The main API used in this project are Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/ , Dadjoke API: https://github.com/KegenGuyll/DadJokes_API , Quote API: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable , Random Joke API: https://github.com/sameerkumar18/geek-joke-api ,

The main idea behind pokemon safari was to able to generate a random pokemon and the ability to catch a pokemon through a random number generator and store pokemon in a pokedex using local storage. When looking at the pokemon in the pokedex you will be able to view the pokemons information and this is where you will be able to interact with the pokemon. The interact button will generated via random number generator to choose from the 3 different APIs(Dad joke, Quote and Random joke).
